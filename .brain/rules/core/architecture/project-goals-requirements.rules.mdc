# Project Goals & Requirements
# Last Updated: Tuesday, April 01, 2025 at 08:02:59 PM

## Goals

[Provide a clear, concise statement of the project's main goals and objectives. Focus on what the project aims to accomplish for its users.]

## Requirements

When understanding user requirements, designing UI, writing code, solving problems, and iterating on the project, always follow these principles:

### Requirements Understanding

- Fully understand user requirements, think from the user's perspective, analyze if there are any missing requirements, and discuss with users to improve requirements.
- Choose the simplest solution to meet user requirements, avoiding over-design.

### UI and Style Design

- Use appropriate UI frameworks that align with project needs, ensuring a clean and professional look that meets current design standards.
- Ensure consistent design and responsive patterns across different platforms and devices.

### Code Writing

- Technology Selection: Choose appropriate technology stack based on project requirements and constraints.
- Code Structure: Emphasize code clarity, modularity, and maintainability. Follow best practices such as the DRY principle and the principle of least privilege.
- Code Security: Always prioritize security when writing code, avoiding vulnerabilities and ensuring secure handling of user input.
- Code Style: Use consistent coding standards and tools to maintain clean and readable code.
- Performance Optimization: Optimize code performance, reduce resource usage, improve loading speed, and ensure the project runs efficiently.
- Testing and Documentation: Write appropriate tests, ensure code robustness, and provide clear comments and documentation for future maintenance.

### Problem Solving

- Thoroughly read related code and understand the underlying application principles.
- Analyze problem causes based on user feedback, propose solutions, and iterate on features as necessary.
- Ensure each code change maintains existing functionality with minimal disruption to the codebase.

### Iteration Optimization

- Maintain close communication with stakeholders, adjust features and design based on feedback, ensuring the application meets requirements.
- Proactively ask for clarification on requirements or technical details when uncertain.
- Update project documentation with each iteration, including feature descriptions, optimization methodology, and iteration notes.
