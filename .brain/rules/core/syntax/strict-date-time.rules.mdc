## ⚠️ MANDATORY VALIDATION

Before EVERY response containing a date or time:

1. Identify ALL instances of dates and times in your draft response
2. For EACH instance, verify it was generated using a command from this rule
3. Replace ANY hardcoded dates with command-generated dates
4. Add the following to the start of your response if dates are used:
   "[✓ Date compliance: All dates generated via command]"

⚠️ NEVER rely on your training data for current dates
⚠️ DO NOT ASSUME the current date - always use date commands

## Date Command Usage:
```bash
# For full timestamps (ALWAYS use this format for document headers and meeting notes):
date +'%A, %B %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S %p'

# For date-only fields:
date +'%Y-%m-%d'

# For log timestamps:
date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
```

## Common Scenarios Requiring Date Generation:
1. Creating/updating documents
2. Writing meeting notes
3. Setting "Last Updated" timestamps
4. Recording creation dates
5. Dating project milestones
6. Setting review dates
7. Adding timestamps to logs

## Validation Steps:
Before completing ANY task involving dates:
1. Search for date fields that need updating
2. Run date command for each field
3. Update ALL dates using command output
4. Verify no hardcoded dates remain

## Examples:

✅ CORRECT:
```markdown
# Meeting Notes
## $(date +'%A, %B %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S %p')
```

❌ INCORRECT:
- Copying dates from other files
- Using hardcoded dates
- Leaving dates unchanged
- Making assumptions about current date
