# Context Initialization Workflow
# Last Updated: xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx:xx xx

## ! Initialize context for the project like this:

1. Read and review `.brain/directory-structure.md` for the directory structure
2. ALWAYS READ `.brain/coding-standards.md` for Best Practices
3. Check `.brain/[agent]/b-features/[current-feature]` for tasks -- ALWAYS update this file with progress, marking x's in the checkboxes after every task completion, do not wait until later.
4. ALWAYS update the CHANGELOG.md after any significant changes are made, then bump the version number according to semantic versioning rules in the @package.json

## !! Important (General)

1. Use `x` as the package manager.
