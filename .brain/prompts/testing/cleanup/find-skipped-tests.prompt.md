# üîç Find and Catalog Skipped Tests

**Purpose:** To scan the entire codebase for skipped tests and generate a centralized markdown task list. This task list will serve as the work plan for fixing the test suite.

## Instructions:

### 1. **Scan for Skipped Tests**
Your primary goal is to find every instance of a skipped test. Use static analysis tools like `grep`, `ripgrep (rg)`, or your internal file search capabilities.

Search for common skip patterns across all test files (`.spec.ts`, `.test.js`, etc.):
* `it.skip(`
* `test.skip(`
* `describe.skip(`
* `xit(` (alias for `it.skip` in some frameworks)
* Tests with an `@disabled` or `@skip` JSDoc tag.

**Example `ripgrep` command:**
```bash
rg --glob="**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}" -e "it.skip|test.skip|describe.skip|xit" --line-number --heading

2. Generate the Task List File
Consolidate all findings into a single markdown file.

File Location: .brain/.testing/
File Name: skipped-tests-todo.md
File Content: Use the template below. Create a checkbox item for every skipped test you discovered.
Markdown

# üõ†Ô∏è Skipped Tests Backlog

**Generated by:** [active-agent-name]
**Timestamp:** [timestamp]

### Instructions for the Fixing Agent:
- Use the `fix-skipped-tests` prompt to work through this list.
- Process one test at a time to keep changes focused.
- Update the checkbox as you complete each item:
  - `- [x] Passed`: The test passed immediately after being un-skipped.
  - `- [x] Fixed`: The test failed after being un-skipped and you successfully fixed it.
  - `- [!] Needs Review`: You were unable to fix the test. You have re-skipped it and added comments explaining the issue.

---

### Task List:

- [ ] **File:** `path/to/auth/login.spec.ts:42`
      **Description:** `it.skip('should redirect to the dashboard after successful login with SSO')`
      **Reason (if any):** `// TODO: Re-enable once SSO provider mock is implemented.`

- [ ] **File:** `path/to/components/data-table.spec.tsx:115`
      **Description:** `test.skip('should correctly sort by date in descending order')`
      **Reason (if any):** `// Flaky in CI, needs investigation.`

3. Handoff
Conclude your run by reporting the total number of skipped tests found and confirming the creation of the task list.

Example concluding message:
"I have scanned the codebase and found [XX] skipped tests. I have created a full backlog at .brain/.testing/skipped-tests-todo.md. Please assign an agent with the fix-skipped-tests prompt to begin resolving them."
