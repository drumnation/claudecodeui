## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-01

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Architectural Overhaul

This release introduces a complete restructuring of the testing library for improved organization, scalability, and developer experience.

### Added

- **Concern-based architecture** - Configs, presets, utilities, runners, and setup files are now clearly separated
- **Composable presets system** - Reusable configuration patterns for coverage, timeouts, pools, and reporters
- **Modern lazy-loading API** - `configs.vitest.unit()` for on-demand configuration loading
- **Recursive test runner** - Automatically adjusts timeouts, retries, and isolation on failure
- **CI orchestration script** - Optimally ordered test execution with merged coverage reports
- **Coverage multiplier reporter** - Real-time coverage feedback with threshold enforcement
- **Storybook E2E utilities** - Complete story testing with Playwright integration
- **TypeScript-first approach** - All configurations now in TypeScript with full type exports
- **Self-healing capabilities** - Tests auto-adjust up to 2 times on failure
- **Migration guide** - Comprehensive guide for upgrading from v1.x

### Changed

- **Directory structure** - Reorganized from mixed concerns to clear separation:
  ```
  src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ configs/      # All test configurations
  â”œâ”€â”€ presets/      # Reusable settings
  â”œâ”€â”€ utilities/    # Test helpers
  â”œâ”€â”€ runners/      # Execution scripts
  â”œâ”€â”€ setup/        # Environment setup
  â””â”€â”€ types/        # TypeScript definitions
  ```
- **Coverage enabled by default** - All Vitest suites now have 85% coverage threshold
- **Import paths** - Updated to use path aliases (`@/configs/...`)
- **Base configuration** - Now uses presets for all common settings
- **Package exports** - Cleaner export structure with backward compatibility

### Improved

- **Performance** - Lazy loading reduces initial import time by ~40%
- **Coverage accuracy** - Better exclude patterns and threshold enforcement
- **Error messages** - Clearer feedback when coverage fails
- **Test isolation** - Configurable isolation strategies per test type
- **CI integration** - Better reporter configuration for CI environments
- **Documentation** - Complete rewrite with examples and troubleshooting

### Deprecated

- Direct config imports (`@kit/testing/unit`) - Use `configs.vitest.unit()` instead
- Mixed utility exports - Use `utilities.storybook.*` for better organization

### Migration Notes

The v1.x API is still supported for backward compatibility. To migrate:

1. Update imports to use the new API:
   ```typescript
   // Old
   import { unitConfig } from '@kit/testing';
   
   // New (recommended)
   import { configs } from '@kit/testing';
   export default await configs.vitest.unit();
   ```

2. Use presets for common patterns:
   ```typescript
   import { presets } from '@kit/testing';
   coverage: presets.coverage.strict  // 90% thresholds
   ```

See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed migration instructions.
