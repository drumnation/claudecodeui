# Component Comparison Notes

## Key Issues to Fix

### 1. Message Parsing (PRIORITY)
- Test buttons work, proving rendering is correct
- Real Claude messages aren't being parsed as tool messages
- Need console output to see actual message structure

### 2. Sidebar Component
- Location: `src/features/projects/components/Sidebar/`
- Original: `src/original-components/Sidebar.original.jsx`
- User reports styling issues

### 3. ChatInterface Styling
- Tool rendering works (test buttons prove this)
- May be missing some styling for regular messages
- Need to compare original vs current

## Original Component Locations
- ChatInterface: Was in `/components/ChatInterface.jsx`, now in `/features/chat/components/ChatInterface/`
- Sidebar: Was in `/components/Sidebar.jsx`, now in `/features/projects/components/Sidebar/`
- MainContent: Was in `/components/MainContent.jsx`, now in `/features/layouts/MainContent/`

## Next Steps
1. Get console output to fix message parsing
2. Compare Sidebar styling line by line
3. Verify ChatInterface message bubbles match original
