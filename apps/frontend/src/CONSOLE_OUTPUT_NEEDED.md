# Console Output Needed

## What to Look For

When you send a message to Claude that triggers a tool use (like "create a todo list"), you should see these console logs:

### 1. First Log: `=== INCOMING MESSAGE TO CHAT SESSION ===`
This shows the raw WebSocket message. We need to see:
- What `messageType` is shown
- What the `dataContent` structure looks like
- The `fullMessage` object

### 2. Second Log: `Processing claude-response - FULL DATA:`
This shows how the chat API is trying to process the message. We need to see:
- The `fullData` structure
- Whether it recognizes tool use

## Possible Scenarios

### Scenario A: Tool data is in a string
If the tool data is coming as a JSON string inside the content, it might look like:
```json
{
  "type": "claude-response",
  "data": {
    "type": "message",
    "content": "{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"name\":\"TodoWrite\"...}"
  }
}
```

### Scenario B: Tool data is nested differently
It might be in a different structure like:
```json
{
  "type": "claude-response", 
  "data": {
    "message": {
      "type": "message",
      "content": [{"type": "tool_use", "name": "TodoWrite"...}]
    }
  }
}
```

### Scenario C: Direct tool message
It might come as:
```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "tool_name": "TodoWrite",
  "tool_input": {...}
}
```

## Once We Know the Structure

Based on what the console shows, I'll update the parser to handle that exact format. The test buttons prove the rendering works - we just need to parse the real messages correctly.
