# Fixes Applied

## 1. Tool Rendering Issue

### Problem
After the TypeScript refactoring, special tool components (TodoWrite, Edit, Write tools) were not displaying properly in the chat interface.

### Solution
- Enhanced the DEBUG_HELPER component to intercept WebSocket messages and log their structure
- Added comprehensive logging to identify the exact message format from the backend
- The debug helper is now active in development mode (bottom-right corner of the app)

### Next Steps
1. Send a message to Claude that triggers a tool (e.g., "Create a todo list")
2. Open browser console and look for messages starting with `ðŸŽ¯ CLAUDE-RESPONSE CAPTURED:`
3. Click "Show Captured" button to see the last 5 claude-response messages
4. Share the console output to complete the fix

## 2. "Load More Sessions" Button Missing

### Problem
The sidebar was only showing 5 sessions per project with no way to load more. The "load more" functionality was lost during the TypeScript refactoring.

### Solution
Restored the following features to the Sidebar component:
- Added `loadingSessions`, `additionalSessions`, and `initialSessionsLoaded` state
- Implemented `loadMoreSessions` function to fetch additional sessions with pagination
- Added `getAllSessions` helper to combine initial and additional sessions
- Added "Show more sessions" button that appears when `hasMore` is true
- Updated session count badge to show "5+" when more sessions are available

The load more button now:
- Appears after the sessions list when there are more sessions to load
- Shows a loading spinner while fetching
- Fetches 5 sessions at a time with proper offset
- Updates the local state without requiring a full refresh

## 3. Session Management Issues

### Observations
- Some conversations might not be appearing in the project list
- There may be issues with session ID management and conversation tracking

### Status
The load more functionality has been restored, which should help reveal all sessions. If sessions are still missing, it may be due to:
- Backend not returning all sessions
- Session IDs not being properly tracked
- WebSocket message handling issues (related to the tool rendering problem)

## Summary

Two major issues have been addressed:
1. **Tool Rendering**: Debug infrastructure is in place to identify the exact message format issue
2. **Load More Sessions**: Fully restored with all original functionality

The tool rendering fix requires capturing real messages from Claude to complete the parser update.
