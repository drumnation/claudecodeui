# Tool Rendering Status

## What's Been Done

### 1. Enhanced MessageComponent.tsx
- Added special rendering for TodoWrite, Edit, and Write tools
- Fixed tool detection to check both `isToolUse` and `type === 'tool_use'`
- Added inline diff visualization for Edit tool
- Added todo list visualization with status indicators
- Added new file preview for Write tool

### 2. Updated Message Parsing
- Enhanced chat API to handle multiple claude-response formats
- Added parsing for tool_use messages in various structures
- Added fallback parsing for tool messages in string content
- Added comprehensive logging to debug message structure

### 3. Added Test Tools
- Created TestToolButton component for easy testing
- Added test buttons for TodoWrite, Edit, and Write tools
- Test buttons will appear at the bottom of the chat in development mode

## How to Test

1. **Use the Test Buttons**: In development mode, you'll see test buttons above the input area. Click them to add test tool messages and verify the rendering works.

2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for these log messages:
   - "Processing claude-response - FULL DATA:" - Shows the raw message structure
   - "Direct tool_use message detected" - Confirms tool message was recognized
   - "Found tool_use in string content" - Indicates parsing from string format

3. **Expected Visual Results**:
   - **TodoWrite**: Shows a visual todo list with checkmarks, status colors, and priority badges
   - **Edit**: Shows inline diff with red/green highlighting and clickable file paths
   - **Write**: Shows new file creation with content preview

## Debugging Steps

If tools still show as raw JSON:

1. **Check Console Logs**: The enhanced logging will show exactly what format messages are coming in
2. **Use Test Buttons**: If test buttons work but real messages don't, the issue is message parsing
3. **Check Message Structure**: The logs will show if messages are coming as:
   - Direct tool_use type
   - Nested in claude-response
   - String content that needs parsing

## Next Steps

Once we identify the exact message format from the console logs, I can update the parser to handle that specific structure. The rendering components are ready and working - we just need to ensure messages are parsed correctly into tool messages.
