## 🤖 Agent Workflow Instructions

**FOR CLAUDE SUB-AGENTS:** These lint issues need manual fixes. Follow this workflow:

### 🚀 Parallel Agent Strategy (Up to 6 Agents)
- **Divide and conquer:** Have up to 6 agents work on different lint rules simultaneously
- **Assignment suggestions:**
  - Agent 1: @typescript-eslint errors
  - Agent 2: react-hooks and react related rules
  - Agent 3: import/export and module rules
  - Agent 4: Code style and formatting issues
  - Agent 5-6: Package-specific issues or warnings
- **Coordination:** Each agent should claim specific rules or packages to avoid conflicts

### 📋 Individual Agent Workflow:
1. **Auto-fix already applied** - These are the remaining manual fixes needed
2. **Pick issues to fix** (group by rule for efficiency)
3. **Fix the issues** in the codebase
4. **Run:** `pnpm brain:lint-failures` to refresh this file
5. **Verify** your fixes resolved the issues
6. **Commit** with message format: `fix: resolve [rule-name] lint issues`

### 📋 Commit Strategy:
- **Few issues (<10):** One commit per rule type
- **Many issues:** Group by severity (errors first, then warnings)

## 📊 Quick Summary
- **Errors:** 0
